# Product Architecture and Roadmap

## 1. Project Identity

This project is a lightweight church spiritual life and ministry workflow system.
It started as a Bible reading check-in app. The current core remains Daily Reading, but the roadmap includes Prayer, Bible Study, Worship Set planning, and Ministry Team Operations.
It is not intended to become a full church ERP.

The app should support spiritual practices and practical ministry coordination: daily Scripture reading, prayer, reflection, group encouragement, Bible study preparation, and eventually focused ministry workflows. It should stay simple, pastoral, and workflow-oriented rather than becoming a broad administrative system.

## 2. Current Status

Daily Reading Core V1 is feature complete and in closure/stabilization.

Prayer V1 is core-complete and in stabilization.

Bible Study Module V1 is implemented and entering QA/stabilization.

Bible Study Worship Set V1 is implemented and entering QA/stabilization.

The role/scoped permission foundation exists.

Navigation cleanup is complete.

Reading Guide Posts are implemented.

ServiceEvent Foundation V1 is implemented and entering QA/stabilization.

MinistryTeam + TeamMembership Foundation is implemented and entering QA/stabilization.

TeamAssignment V1 is implemented and entering QA/stabilization.

My Serving Page V1 is implemented and entering QA/stabilization.

Lighting Team Pilot, checklist, and scheduling enhancements are still future phases.

The entire project is not complete. The stable center is Daily Reading, Prayer, Bible Study, ServiceEvent foundation, generic MinistryTeam foundation, manual TeamAssignment V1, and My Serving Page V1; future pilot workflows and scheduling operations should be added deliberately and kept within clear boundaries.

## 5. Current Phase

Current phase:

Reading, Prayer, Bible Study, Bible Study Worship Set, ServiceEvent Foundation, MinistryTeam Foundation, TeamAssignment V1, and My Serving Page V1 are in closure / QA / stabilization.

Next major product phase:

Lighting Team Pilot Data.

Checklist, availability, swap requests, reminder automation, and advanced scheduling remain future.

Before new large features:
- Keep tests passing.
- Preserve bilingual behavior.
- Avoid top-nav clutter.
- Keep Daily Reading from absorbing unrelated ministry workflows.
- Keep Bible Study from becoming a full event or ministry scheduling system.
- Keep ServiceEvent, MinistryTeam, TeamAssignment, and My Serving workflows generic until pilot workflows are separately planned.

## 6. Roadmap

## 7. Explicit Non-Goals

This project should not become a full church ERP.

Do not build:
- Finance / offering
- Payroll
- Full CRM
- Children check-in
- Legal/compliance system
- Asset management
- Complete HR/personnel system
- Automatic scheduling algorithm in early phases
- Full worship song library in early phases
- Complex lighting scene database
- ShowXpress training database
- Private counseling notes
- Zoom passwords
- Broad sensitive contact import

Do not copy entire Google Docs or Google Sheets into the database.
The system should manage structured workflow and responsibility, not swallow every document.
Training docs, useful links, and detailed tips can remain in Google Docs and be linked.

## 8. Permission Model

Do not model church roles as a strict hierarchy. Use capability-based permissions.

Current roles may include:
- pastor
- elder
- deacon
- district_leader
- group_leader
- coworker

Capabilities are granted through active ChurchRoleAssignment rows, plus staff/superuser override.

Existing examples:
- CAP_PUBLISH_READING_GUIDES
- CAP_MANAGE_BIBLE_STUDIES
- CAP_PUBLISH_BIBLE_STUDY_GUIDES
- View group/district/all progress capabilities
- Moderation capabilities
- Manage reading plans / users where applicable

Future capabilities should be added only when a future workflow needs them.

Implemented service and ministry foundation capabilities:
- CAP_MANAGE_SERVICE_EVENTS
- CAP_MANAGE_MINISTRY_TEAMS
- CAP_MANAGE_TEAM_ASSIGNMENTS

## 9. Codex Task Rules

For future Codex prompts:
- Run tests before and after substantial changes.
- Keep each task narrow.
- Do not add unrelated features.
- Do not rename URLs unless explicitly requested.
- Do not add top-nav clutter.
- Preserve bilingual UI.
- Tests with language-specific text must set `session["language"]`.
- Prefer contextual links over global navigation.
- Respect module boundaries.
- Do not introduce sensitive data fields without explicit approval.
- Do not build automatic scheduling until manual scheduling workflow is proven.
- Do not replace Google Docs for playbooks; link to them.

## 10. Definition of Done

For feature tasks:
- Model/design fits module boundary.
- Permissions are clear.
- User-facing text is bilingual.
- Normal user and staff behavior are tested.
- Hidden/private/group-scoped data does not leak.
- Existing all-app tests pass.
- Navigation is not cluttered.
- No unnecessary migrations.
- No unrelated refactors.
